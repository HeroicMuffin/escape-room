Bash Escape Room
================
The Bash Escape Room is a Docker based excercise (dont worry, well learn much more about Docker a bit later).

In order to start the game:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed (you can check by running `which docker`). If not, then find and follow the official documentation instructions for your OS.
2. Make sure you _do not_ need `sudo` in order to run `docker` (you can check by running `docker ps`). If not, then -again- find and follow the official documentation isntructions to add your user to the Docker group.
3. Build the escape room: `docker build -t escape-room .` (dont forget the at the end of the command - its important!).
4. Run the game: `docker run -it escape-room` (further instructions inside!).

Good Luck!
